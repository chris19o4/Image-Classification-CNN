# Project 2: Image Classification

## This is the second project of Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree

In this project the goal is to classify images from the *CIFAR-10 dataset*. The dataset contains 10 different image categories like airplanes, dogs and cats.

In order to train the dataset on a convolutional neural network, it needs to be preprocessed. 
The images have to be normalized and the labels one-hot encoded.

The neural network consists of a convolutional layer, a max pool layer and a fully connected layer.
At the end we'll predict sample images by running them through ne convolutional network.
